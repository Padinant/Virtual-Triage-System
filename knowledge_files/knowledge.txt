SECTION 4: Commonly Requested Resources

This section includes details about resources and forms that are frequently asked for or needed by students and faculty.
The way this section is organized is that it details scenarios that a student or faculty member find themselves in. For each scenario, the text explains how an assistant should guide the user on how to proceed, and which resources or forms (if any) should the assistant provide to the user.
There are some scenarios where the instructions are different based on whether the person is a student or a faculty member (such as a Teaching Assistant, Lab Assistant, professor, etc.). The assistant may ask the user whether they are a student or faculty, and guide them accordingly.
Note that in some cases, a user may be both a student and a faculty member (for example, a user can be a PhD student AND have a teaching role for an undergraduate course). In those cases, the assistant may provide both the student and the faculty approaches, if the scenario matches both of the user's roles.


Here is the list of commonly requested Forms, Links, and Administrative Resources:

Scenario 1: Person wants to request card swipe access to a CSEE room.
Scenario 1, Case 1 (FACULTY): If the person is a CSEE faculty member, they can request room swipe access via filling out the ‘CSEE Room Access Request’ form. Note that only faculty and staff are permitted to complete this form.
‘CSEE Room Access Request’ form URL link: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScQs5QiJrMrFbYqA4PnOLEP2VfJc_39EujAZEb3MU0P76RS2g/viewform?c=0&w=1 .
The ‘CSEE Room Access Request’ form can also be found by navigating to the CSEE department website → ‘Faculty Resources’ → ‘Forms, Department Links & Business Affairs’


Scenario 1, Case 2 (STUDENT): If the person who wants to request card swipe or room access is a student (and is not a faculty at UMBC).
In this case, the student should reach out via email (or in person) to the CSEE faculty member who is related to the reason they are requesting the room.
(For example, if a student has recently became a lab assistant and wants swipe access to the research lab, the student should ask the specific faculty member or professor who hired the student as a lab assistant for the lab. Then, that faculty can request swipe access to the for you from the department.)

Scenario 2: Person wants to make a reservation request for a room
The person can make a reservation request from the CSEE department for a room via filling out the 'Room Reservation Request' form.
'Room Reservation Request' form URL link: https://goo.gl/forms/SPcnmMzkKKDUC6rn2 .
The 'Room Reservation Request' form an also be found by navigating to the CSEE department website → ‘Faculty Resources’ → ‘Forms, Department Links & Business Affairs’

Students can complete more than one track with the caveat that two courses in each track cannot be used towards any other tracks. Therefore, one track requires 4 courses. Two tracks require a minimum of 6 courses. Three tracks require a minimum of 9 courses.
If you have declared that you are following a track and complete its requirements before graduating, a notation that you have completed it will appear on your transcript. There is no penalty for declaring that you intend to follow a track but failing to complete all of its requirements.

Computer Science Minor:
Students interested in pursuing a Minor in Computer Science must complete the Minor Requirements. Because of the similarities between the Computer Science and Computer Engineering programs, students cannot  major in Computer Engineering and minor in Computer Science.

Combined BS/MS Program (Computer Science):
Students who see Graduate School in their future can choose to enroll in the combined B.S./ M.S. program, which will allow them to speedily complete a B.S. in Computer Science and an M.S. in Computer Science.

Computer Engineering Major:
Students pursuing a Bachelor’s of Science in Computer Engineering must complete 125 credits of required and elective courses. These requirements include the General Education Program requirements established by the University for the Bachelor of Science Degree. The Computer Engineering degree offers three tracks: Electronic Systems, Communications, and Cybersecurity. 
The Electronic Systems track focuses on large electronic systems and networks. Students who specialize in this track will emerge with experience in VLSI (very large scale integrated) design and the design of programmable logic devices, including FPGAs (fully programmable gate arrays). The Communications track focuses on computer and electrical communications networks. Students who specialize in this track will emerge with experience in the electromagnetic and signal processing techniques that are needed to design these networks. The Cybersecurity track emphasizes security of computer systems, along with in depth design of computer hardware topics closely related to the Electronic Systems Track.
